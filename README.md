# ERCF

This is a simple mount for the ERCF, mounted on top of a Voron 2.4 350. If the mount also fits on smaller printers I can not say. Maybe the profile between the printed holders is too short to mount an ERCF.

The parts were printed before the ERCF was in use, so the letters were designed to be glued in place.
